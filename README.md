# Project 13 - React Native App ðŸ“±

In this week's project at Technigo Bootcamp, I built my first mobile application with React Native! I chose to make a recipe app using the Edamam API. If I had more time I would've added more pickers or checkboxes to make a slimmer search possible.

Here you can see it in Expo: https://snack.expo.io/@hippiekick/3984f4
